# Design-Patterns-Using-Python  
  
This is my Python 3 implementation for all design patterns in the book:  
  
*Head First Design Patterns*  
  
The examples in the book are in Java, but I'm a Pythonista.. So here I am.  
  
**This is still a WIP. I'll update this README when I finish the book.**  
  
Please get in touch if my code should be improved some how or if you want  
  
me to illustrate something. Thank you.
